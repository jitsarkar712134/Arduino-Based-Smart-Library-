Using Arduino IDE , C Programing language , IR sensor, some modules and many electronics components, etc  

ðŸŒ working principle ::

     â€¢â€¢ When you enter the library, the library's Fan will automatically turn on, and when you exit the library, the fan will turn off.

        Additionally, inside the library, each table has a #tablelamp, and its function is such that when a person sits at the table to read a book, the table lamp will light up.
             When the person leaves the table, the table lamp will dim. This system is designed with the goal of saving electricity because 
               many people come to the library, turn on the lights and fan, and often forget to turn them off, resulting in unnecessary power consumption.
            Hence, this arrangement helps conserve electricity.

       If the same smart system is applied to the restroom, it could work in a similar way. 
       When someone enters the restroom, the lights automatically turn on, ensuring visibility.
             When they leave, the lights can be set to turn off to save energy. Additionally, you can install motion-activated faucets, soap dispensers, and hand dryers to promote hygiene and reduce water and electricity usage.
